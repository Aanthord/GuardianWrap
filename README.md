# Guardian Wrapper Project

## Overview

The Guardian Wrapper Project enhances Linux application security through advanced monitoring techniques. It includes stack canary monitoring to detect buffer overflows, secure logging with BLAKE3 hashing for log integrity, and dynamic response mechanisms for real-time security incident handling.

### Project Objectives

- **Enhance Application Security**: Monitor applications in real-time for security breaches and respond dynamically to threats.
- **Secure Logging**: Implement secure logging mechanisms using BLAKE3 hashing to ensure log integrity.
- **Automated Response**: Develop automated response strategies for various security incidents, enhancing application resilience.
